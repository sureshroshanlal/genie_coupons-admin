═══ FRESH RESEARCH (use this — do not invent) ═══
${JSON.stringify(research, null, 2)}

${dbFacts}

═══ WRITING RULES — ALL ARE MANDATORY ═══
TONE: ${tone.label} — ${tone.instruction}
ANGLE: ${angle.label} — ${angle.instruction}
BLUEPRINT: ${blueprint.label}

SEO TITLE RULES:
- Must include the store name + primary keyword (e.g. "coupons", "promo codes", "discount codes")
- If DB has a max discount, lead with it: e.g. "Up to 45% Off ${merchantName} Coupons & Promo Codes"
- NO month, NO year, NO date of any kind
- Under 65 characters
- Must sound like a human wrote it, not a template

META DESCRIPTION RULES:
- 140-155 characters
- Must reference the specific category (${category}), a concrete saving figure from DB if available, and end with a soft CTA
- Include at least 2 focus keywords naturally — not stuffed
- No AI filler phrases ("discover", "explore", "unlock", "best deals await")
- Must read like a human wrote it for a real shopper

H1 RULES:
- Completely different phrasing from the SEO title
- Must be unique to THIS store — reference something specific about ${merchantName} from the research
- Under 68 characters
- NO month, NO year

LSI/SEMANTIC KEYWORD INJECTION RULES:
- You will be given 15 LSI keywords in your output
- Every section body MUST contain 1-3 of these LSI keywords used in natural sentences
- Keywords must fit the sentence meaning — never bolded, never listed, never forced
- Spread them across all sections — not all in one place
- A reader should not be able to tell keywords were inserted

CONTENT UNIQUENESS RULES:
- Every section must reference at least one specific fact about ${merchantName} from RESEARCH or DB STATS
- Do not use generic statements that could apply to any store in the ${category} category
- The content must be identifiably about ${merchantName} — not a template with the name swapped in
- Banned phrases: "combining discounts", "strategic shopping", "budget-focused shoppers", "unlock savings", "smart shopper", "dive into", "look no further", "in today's world", "seamless experience", "game-changer"

DATE RULES:
- NO month names, NO year numbers, NO "current", NO "latest" in any field
- Time references must be evergreen: "regularly", "frequently", "often", "at checkout"

H1 BANNED PATTERNS — never use these constructs:
- "${merchantName} Coupons & Promo Codes"
- "${merchantName} Coupons"
- "Save at ${merchantName}"
- "${merchantName} Discount Codes"
- "Best ${merchantName} Deals"
- Any H1 that could apply to any other store just by swapping the name
- H1 must reference something genuinely specific to ${merchantName} from the research or DB stats

FAQ RULES — READ CAREFULLY:
- Write exactly ${variation.faqCount} questions for this store
- Each question is assigned a specific TYPE below — follow the type instruction exactly
- BANNED question skeletons (never use):
  * "Does ${merchantName} offer coupons?"
  * "How do I use a ${merchantName} coupon?"
  * "What is the best ${merchantName} coupon?"
  * "Does ${merchantName} have a discount?"
  * Any question answerable for ANY store by just swapping the name
- Every answer must be 2-4 sentences and reference actual DB STATS or RESEARCH data
- Questions must be genuinely different from each other in structure and angle

ASSIGNED FAQ QUESTION TYPES FOR ${merchantName}:
${variation.faqTypes.map((f, i) => `Q${i + 1} [${f.id.toUpperCase()}]: ${f.instruction}`).join("\n")}

Return ONLY valid JSON — no preamble, no markdown:
